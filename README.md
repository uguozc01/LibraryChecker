## LibraryChecker
check which libraries a github user has used for a spesific programming language in their projects


## GENERAL

  By providing a github profile and a language extension such as "py" you can find out what libraries a person imported/used in his/her github projects
  For Java need small functional change or addition
  Would not work for C, C++ lib.
